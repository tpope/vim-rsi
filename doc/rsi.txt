INTRODUCTION                                    *rsi*

This plugin provides Readline (Emacs) mappings for insert and command line
mode that try not to overlap with built-in Vim functionality.

MAPS                                            *rsi-maps*

                                                *rsi-CTRL-A*
<C-a>                   Go to beginning of line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-X_CTRL-A*
<C-x><C-a>              Access Vim's built-in |i_CTRL-A| or |c_CTRL-A|.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-B*
<C-b>                   Go backwards one character.  On a blank line, kill it
                        and go back to the previous line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-D*
<C-d>                   Delete character in front of cursor.  Falls back to
                        |i_CTRL-D| or |c_CTRL-D| at the end of the line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-E*
<C-e>                   Go to end of line.  Falls back to |i_CTRL-E| if
                        already at the end of the line.  (|c_CTRL-E| already
                        goes to end of line, so it is not mapped.)

                                                *rsi-CTRL-F*
<C-f>                   Move forward one character.  Falls back to
                        |i_CTRL-F| or |c_CTRL-F| at the end of the line.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-G*
<C-g>                   Return to normal mode from the |cmdline|.

                                                *rsi-CTRL-T*
<C-t>                   Transpose two characters.  This is mapped in command
                        line mode only, as |i_CTRL-T| is too important to
                        clobber.

                                                *rsi-META-BS*
<M-BS>                  Delete backward one word.

                                                *rsi-META-b*
<M-b>                   Go backwards one word.

                                                *rsi-META-d*
<M-d>                   Delete forwards one word.

                                                *rsi-META-f*
<M-f>                   Go forwards one word.

                                                *rsi-META-n*
<M-n>                   Equivalent to |c_<Down>| or |i_<Down>|.

                                                *rsi-META-p*
<M-p>                   Equivalent to |c_<Up>| or |i_<Up>|.

In the terminal, the meta key sends escape, so mapping these would require
mappings starting with escape in insert mode.  This makes Vim appear to lag
for a second if you actually press just escape.  Instead, rsi.vim makes
these available by telling Vim they are existing special keys. For example,
the key code for <S-Left> is changed to <Esc>b.

To disable meta maps, add the following to your vimrc:
>
    let g:rsi_no_meta = 1
<
ABOUT                                           *rsi-about*
